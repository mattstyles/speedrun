# Speedrun

Useful for quickly getting demos up and running with a js build chain, using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

Best used locally to the demo project youâ€™re working on and run using [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

* Create an entry point, either an html file or a js file
* Add `speedrun` to your project
* Add a start task as an npm script

```sh
npm i -D speedrun
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "speedrun main.js"
}
```

```sh
npm start
```

Given a `main.js` file then the above steps will scaffold an html file, use `parcel` to create a bundle and start a dev server to run your project. The running task will be watching for changes.

### Global

`speedrun` works equally as well as a global install, but local is generally preferred.

```sh
npm i -g speedrun
speedrun main.js
```

### Programmatic

`speedrun` can also be run programmatically.

```sh
npm i -D speedrun
```

```js
const { run } = require('speedrun')

run({
  entry: './main.js'
})
```

## Detailed Start

`speedrun` is a simplified wrapper around `parcel`. It is very deliberately simplified as it should only be used for tests and demos. If your use-case requires more control over the `parcel bundler` API then itâ€™s worth writing that wrapper yourself, feel free to use `speedrun`s `index.js` to help although it doesnâ€™t do anything (other than scaffold an html file when required) that isnâ€™t outlined in detail in the [parcel API documentation](https://parceljs.org/api.html).

Parcel gives you access to a modern JS toolchain with zero config (other bundlers also offer this, but `speedrun` uses `parcel`). Parcel requires an `html` file as an entry point which is usually a good thing to create, but, sometimes you just want to fire some JS in to the browser without mucking around, which is where `speedrun` comes in.

Create a new project, add a JS file to it and create a `package.json` for npm:

```sh
mkdir my-awesome-demo
cd my-awesome-demo
touch main.js
npm init -y
```

Add some JS to `main.js` (feel free to use the latest JS language features, including ES6 modules, although `parcel` offers you far more than only this):

```js
const echo = str => console.log(str)
echo('Arrow functions are supported almost everywhere ðŸ˜‚, this example is terrible!')
```

See [https://parceljs.org/](https://parceljs.org/) for some more things you now have access to for your demo.

Now add `speedrun` to your project:

```sh
npm i -D speedrun
```

This will have installed `parcel-bundler` too (as well as some other stuff).

Add an `npm start` script to your `package.json` (if you followed the above steps to the letter there will already be a `test` script scaffold in there, leave it or delete as you like, this project is only a demo right?):

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "start": "speedrun main.js"
}
```

Finally, run that start script and `speedrun` will generate a (very) basic html file for you and poke at `parcel` to do all the heavy lifting:

```sh
npm start
```

Parcel will now be running in dev and watch modes, so go ahead and play with your `main.js` file all you like and get access to all the stuff (including HMR) that parcel gives you.

Note that to keep paths consistent `speedrun` will generate an html file for you in the current directory, it will always take the name of the entry point you supply and add a hash to it, so, if youâ€™re worried about accidentally committing it then add `main.*.html` to your `.gitignore` (if using `main.js` as an entry point).

Donâ€™t worry too much though, `speedrun` will delete the generated html file for you when it finishes.

## Customising Parcel

`speedrun` currently does not expose any method for adding options to parcel-bundler, this is by design. Quick tests and demos seldom should rely on more complex configuration. If parcel defaults arenâ€™t sufficient for your demo then itâ€™s worth spending a few minutes writing a quick script yourself, feel free to use the `index.js` file within `speedrun` as a starting point, but reading through the [parcel API docs](https://parceljs.org/api.html) will get you further faster.

Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with starting with `speedrun` and adding real build and run scripts later if your demo evolves. `speedrun` just uses `parcel` to do 99% of the work, so use the parcel docs to help you create build and watch tasks.

If you wanted to add some config, like babel config for example, then if `parcel` supports it then so will `speedrun`.

## API

`speedrun` exposes just one method, `run`, which accepts some parameters:

```js
{
  entry: './',
  port: 3000,
  deleteHtml: false,
  autoOpen: true
}
```

These default options will be supplied if you donâ€™t supply keys, e.g:

```js
import { run } from 'speedrun'

run({
  entry: './main.js',
  autoOpen: false
})
```

The above script will not automatically launch the browser but will create scaffold an html and run the `main.js` script.

### `entry` [`string`]

This entry point for the project.

Parcel supports multiple entry points, `speedrun` supports multiple html entry points **only**. If you give it multiple JS entry points, it wonâ€™t work.

Add it as an argument to the cli, i.e.

```sh
speedrun main.js
```

### `port` [`int`]

Supply a specific port. `speedrun` will attempt to use the port you supply, or 3000 if you leave the default, but it will also try other ports if that one is busy.

Pass as `-p` or `--port` to the cli.

### `deleteHtml` [`boolean`]

If you donâ€™t want to delete the generated html one when you use a js file as an entry point then supply false. Ordinarily you wonâ€™t want to do this, the generated html is not very interesting.

This option can not be passed via the cli.

### `autoOpen` [`boolean`]

If you want to stop `speedrun` from attempting to launch your browser then supply false.

Pass as `-o` or `--open` to the cli.
